Overview
This Python-based password strength evaluator uses tkinter to provide a graphical user interface (GUI). The application evaluates password strength based on criteria such as length, character diversity, and common patterns, offering real-time feedback and a visual strength meter to help users create secure passwords.

The Password Strength Evaluator:

Assesses password length and character diversity (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters).
Detects common patterns like repeated sequences and keyboard patterns.
Compares passwords against a list of common passwords.
Provides detailed feedback to improve password strength.
Displays a password strength meter in a user-friendly GUI.

Main Parts of the Code

This Password Strength Evaluator is intended for educational purposes only. While it provides guidance on creating stronger passwords, it should not be solely relied upon for securing sensitive accounts. Users should follow best practices for password management, including using unique passwords for different accounts, enabling two-factor authentication where available, and regularly updating passwords. The developers of this application do not assume any responsibility for the security of passwords evaluated using this tool. Always use additional security measures to protect sensitive information.
