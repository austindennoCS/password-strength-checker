# Password Strength Evaluator

## Overview

This Python-based password strength evaluator uses `tkinter` to provide a graphical user interface (GUI). The application evaluates password strength based on criteria such as length, character diversity, and common patterns, offering real-time feedback and a visual strength meter to help users learn more about secure passwords.

## Summary

The Password Strength Evaluator:
- Assesses password length and character diversity (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters).
- Detects common patterns like repeated sequences and keyboard patterns.
- Compares passwords against a list of common passwords.
- Provides detailed feedback to improve password strength.
- Displays a password strength meter in a user-friendly GUI.
